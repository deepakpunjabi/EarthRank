# Graph

- Collection of nodes with edges between **(some of)** them.
- Directed vs Undirected
- `Graph = [] subgraphs`
- If there is a path between all nodes than it's a **connected graph**.
- Cyclic vs Acyclic graph
- Adjacency List vs Adjacency Matrices

## Graph Traversal

- DFS vs BFS
- DFS is often preferred if we want to visit every node in the graph.
- If we want to find the shortest path (or just any path) between two nodes, BFS is generally better.
- Tree traversals are a form of DFS.
