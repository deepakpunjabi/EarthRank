# Tree

- Tree need not be a binary tree or binary search tree.
- For BST(with duplicate values): `left nodes <= root < right nodes` order property is maintained
- Complete Binary tree is where every level of the tree is filled(left to right), except for perhaps the last level.
- Full binary tree is where every node has 0/2 child, no node has 1 child. No left->right order is required.
- Perfect binary tree = full + complete + all leaf nodes are at same level. ie. tree has 2^L-1 nodes.
- Tree is a **connected** graph without cycles.

## Binary tree traversal

- inorder travelsal gives you all nodes in ascending order
